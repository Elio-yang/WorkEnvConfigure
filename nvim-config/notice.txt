#====================something about nvim install
1. first you should install the latest nvim from website
2. nodejs>12.12 is needed
3. be careful of the ~/.bash_profile of nodejs
4. when installing the plugins : if it can't be installed due to network reason
	there is a way to solve that : just go to the dir  ~/.vim and git clone 
	those plugins you want from github manually.
5. also if you even can't get the Plug management ,go to the website and git clone
	the .vim file to specified dir.
